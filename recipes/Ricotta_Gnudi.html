       <h3>Making gnudi, or Italian ricotta dumplings, only sounds fancy.</h3>
       <p>They're actually an easy <strong><em>pasta dinner</em></strong> anyone can pull off.
        If you love gnocchi as much as we do (make sure to check 
        out this <strong><em>Sheet Pan Burrata Caprese</em></strong> recipe), you'll likely love these too. 
        The only real difference? Gnocchi is made with potato and gnudi is made with ricotta,
        which makes them even more tender, light, and plump.</p>

        <p>Here, we've amped up gnudi with a browned butter sauce, peas (fresh or frozen work), and crispy mint.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 c.</strong> whole-milk ricotta</li>
            <li><strong>1 c.</strong> freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li><strong>1 c.</strong> all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 c.</strong> (1 stick) butter</li>
            <li><strong>16</strong> to 20 fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li><strong>11/2 c.</strong> sweet peas, fresh or frozen and defrosted</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Recipe Instructions (Steps)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with 3 or 4 layers of paper towels.
                Evenly spread ricotta on paper towels. Lay more paper towels on top of ricotta and use
                your hands to blot excess moisture.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer ricotta to a large mixing bowl. Add Parmesan, eggs, 1 teaspoon salt,
                1 tablespoon black pepper, and 1/2 cup flour and stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>Clean baking sheet and line with parchment paper.
                Spread 1/4 cup flour on parchment with your hands.
                Scoop level tablespoons of gnudi dough into your
                floured hands and gently roll each into a ball.
                Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, 
                adding more flour as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup flour on top of gnudi. Gently roll gnudi in flour until coated. </li>
            <li>Transfer baking sheet to refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, fill a large pot with 2" water and bring to a boil.
                Season with 2 large pinches of salt. Using a slotted spoon,
                gently add gnudi to pot, in batches to avoid overcrowding, 
                and cook until they float to the top, 2 minutes. Transfer to a large serving plate.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, brown butter, slowly whisking, 5 to 6 minutes.
                Once it begins to lightly brown, add mint and let crisp, 1 minute. Transfer mint to a small plate.
            </li>
            <li>Add peas to skillet and cook until slightly soft, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon peas and browned butter over gnudi and top with crispy mint leaves and Parmesan.
                Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
