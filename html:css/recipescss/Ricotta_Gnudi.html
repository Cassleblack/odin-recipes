        <h4 class="sub-heading">Recipe Instructions (Steps)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with 3 or 4 layers of paper towels.
                Evenly spread ricotta on paper towels. Lay more paper towels on top of ricotta and use
                your hands to blot excess moisture.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer ricotta to a large mixing bowl. Add Parmesan, eggs, 1 teaspoon salt,
                1 tablespoon black pepper, and 1/2 cup flour and stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>Clean baking sheet and line with parchment paper.
                Spread 1/4 cup flour on parchment with your hands.
                Scoop level tablespoons of gnudi dough into your
                floured hands and gently roll each into a ball.
                Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, 
                adding more flour as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup flour on top of gnudi. Gently roll gnudi in flour until coated. </li>
            <li>Transfer baking sheet to refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, fill a large pot with 2" water and bring to a boil.
                Season with 2 large pinches of salt. Using a slotted spoon,
                gently add gnudi to pot, in batches to avoid overcrowding, 
                and cook until they float to the top, 2 minutes. Transfer to a large serving plate.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, brown butter, slowly whisking, 5 to 6 minutes.
                Once it begins to lightly brown, add mint and let crisp, 1 minute. Transfer mint to a small plate.
            </li>
            <li>Add peas to skillet and cook until slightly soft, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon peas and browned butter over gnudi and top with crispy mint leaves and Parmesan.
                Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
