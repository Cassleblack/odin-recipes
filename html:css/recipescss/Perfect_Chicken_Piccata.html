        <h4 class="sub-heading">Recipe Instructions (Steps)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut chicken breasts in half parallel to work surface all the way through.
                In between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, pound each breast until 1/4" thick;
                generously season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large shallow bowl, place flour. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess.
                In a large skillet over high heat, heat 1/4 cup oil until very hot.
                Working with 3 chicken pieces at a time, cook, turning once, until golden brown,
                about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
                Adjust heat as needed and repeat with remaining chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                In same skillet over high heat, bring wine, broth, and lemon juice to a boil.
                Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced by about one-quarter, about 5 minutes.
                Reduce heat to low and add butter, one piece at a time, vigorously whisking after each addition;
                donâ€™t stop whisking until all butter is incorporated.
                If sauce starts to break, add 1 tablespoon water and 
                continue to whisk until sauce is smooth and glossy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return chicken to skillet. Add capers, bring sauce to a light simmer,
                and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. 
                Serve with lemon wedges alongside.
            </li>
        </ol>
